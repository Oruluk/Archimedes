# Archimedes
Assembly often is not straight forward. To make it more intuitive **Archimedes** visualizes assembly steps by using the Wikitude plugin and makes it less error-prone. The user can thereby project the next steps onto the unfinished workpiece and watch them from different perspectives.

Benefits:
- More intuitive visualization of assembly steps
- Many application sites (at production lines, at customers', maintenance etc.)
- Less assembly failures
